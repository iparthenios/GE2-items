# Asthmatic patients in a Greek School
## Παραδοχές
Τόπος: Σχολικο κτίριο - Προαύλιο -Αθλητικές εγκαταστάσεις
Personas: Asthmatic patient, school teacher, school headmaster, other student, utility personnel
Sensor Network: Interior and exterior sensors cover the whole area
https://www.iqair.com/air-quality-monitors offers the appropriate devices to cover the whole school area. By combining the both interior and exterior measurements the system provides for a complete air quality picture.
The system measures 8 different parameters: 
- PM1
- PM 2.5
- PM 10
- CO2
- AQI 
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Air Pressure
The system also combines measurements taken from https://waqi.info
Dust, particularly fine particulate matter (PM2.5), is an important factor to consider for individuals with asthma. 
Fine particles, such as those found in dust, can be inhaled deeply into the lungs and may trigger or worsen asthma symptoms.
The system could also provide for:
To minimize exposure to dust, asthmatic individuals should consider the following measures:
- Use air purifiers with HEPA filters to reduce indoor particulate matter.
- Regularly clean and dust indoor surfaces, including carpets, curtains, and furniture.
- Keep windows closed during periods of high outdoor dust levels or poor air quality.
- Use allergen-proof bedding and pillow covers to reduce exposure to dust mites.
## The Application Components
A proposal for an integrated air quality monitoring and information system for asthmatic patients in a Greek school setting.
This integrated system aims to provide comprehensive, real-time air quality information and guidance tailored to the specific needs of asthmatic individuals in a school environment.


# Wearable Watch App for Asthmatic Patients:

**Features:**
- Real-time air quality updates specific to the wearer's location within the school premises.
- Personalized asthma risk notifications based on current air quality conditions.
- Integration with health data to provide tailored recommendations.
- Emergency inhaler locator within the school premises.
  
**Alerts:**
- High PM levels
- Poor air quality alerts
- Recommended actions for the wearer to take

# Mobile App for All Personas:

**Features:**
- Overview of real-time air quality across different areas of the school (interior and exterior).
- Notifications for significant air quality changes.
- Asthma management tips and recommendations.
- Integration with the wearable watch app for personalized alerts.
  
**User Roles:**
- Asthmatic patients
- School teachers
- School headmaster
** Other students
- Utility personnel
  
**Alerts:**
- General air quality alerts
- School-wide announcements from the headmaster
- Tips for minimizing exposure to poor air quality
# Real-Time Information on Wall Screens:

**Features:**
- Large display screens at key locations (e.g., school entrance, common areas).
- Real-time air quality data visualization.
- Emergency alerts and evacuation procedures in case of severe air quality issues.
- General air quality awareness messages.
  
**Content:**
- PM1, PM2.5, PM10 levels
- CO2 levels
- AQI (Air Quality Index)
- Temperature, Humidity, Air Pressure
  
**Alerts:**
- Visual cues for different air quality levels (green, yellow, red).
- Evacuation alerts in case of emergencies.
# Integration with IQAir and WAQI:

**Data Sources:**
- IQAir air quality monitors within the school.
- External data from waqi.info for a comprehensive air quality picture.

**Benefits:**
- More accurate and detailed air quality information.
- Historical data analysis for trend identification.
- Integration of external data for a broader context.
# Educational Materials Section:

**Features:**
- Information on the impact of different pollutants on health.
- Tips for maintaining good indoor air quality.
- Educational content for students on the importance of air quality.
- Resources for teachers to incorporate air quality education into the curriculum.

  
**Implementation Considerations:**
- User Training: Conduct training sessions for all users on how to interpret air quality data and take appropriate actions.
- Emergency Protocols: Establish clear protocols for emergency situations, including communication and evacuation procedures.
- Privacy and Security: Ensure that the system complies with privacy regulations and employs robust security measures to protect sensitive health data.
- This integrated system aims to provide comprehensive, real-time air quality information and guidance tailored to the specific needs of asthmatic individuals in a school environment.
